A Free Zip Code Database + Latitude and Longitude

Database Updated: 1/22/2012

Send feedback. How can we make this database more useful?
Sorry, No County information. Postal Service delivery areas are not designated by county.

Several people have requested greater precision in the Latitude and Longitude. The values are provided to two decimal places or more. Since a degree of latitude is about 62 miles, one one-hundredth is .62 miles, Similarlly, for the populated places in the US, a degree of latitudes is less than 65 miles. So the numeric values are a single point falls within a quite small area of about a mile for rounding errors. This is far more numerical precision than actual geograhic reality. Zip codes represent delivery routes for the post office. Occasionally as well defined as a single building, or several hundred miles of wilderness, or even a moving ship(no locations for these, of course), usually they are several square miles and the issue is not the number of decimal places. If you find that a zipcode is not at the location listed, please let me know so we can research it and find more accurate locations.

 

NEW Zipcode database based on suggestions of over 100 people.

    Format: CSV is popular and easiest use.
    Sources: Rebuilt using authoritative sources
    Census demographics are out. Census Zip Code Tabulations Areas (ZCTAs) just aren't compatible with Postal Service zip codes.
    Internal Revenue Service demographics are in. IRS Zip codes are compatible (The zip of the filers primary residence).

    The Census publishes data, but they use Zipcode Tabulation Areas (ZCTAs) which 1) have changed areas between the 2000 census and the 2010 census 2) do not map well to USPS zipcodes well. If needed http://www.census.gov/geo/ZCTA/zcta.html
